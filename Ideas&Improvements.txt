1: Use Typescript.

2: Write end-to-end cypress test: This may be useful to reduce bugs and have end-to-end testing. 
Cypress can be beneficial when we have more than one SPA app component.

3: Use dotenv for constants, URLs, and credentials. It can be helpful to handle various environments like development,
staging and production.

4. Searching and filtering can be pushed to the backend via API for large data sets. 
At this point, calling API onChange event will not be beneficial and can cause the whole portal's slowness. 
But even better would be elastic search. We can also include pagination in the backend by getting X records in one go.

5: Include logging. Logging can be helpful to debug. To extend even further, we can also include structured logging.

6: Show default 404 not found or error page.
